      Title:  Geometric structure of self covering manifolds
    
      Abstract: A topological space is self-covering if the space is a non-trivial
      cover of itself. I will talk about a joint work with Lizhen Qin and Botong 
      Wang on the geometric structure of self-covering manifolds. For example, 
      we show that in dimension >5, a self-covering manifold with infinite cyclic 
      fundamental group is a fiber bundle over the circle. We also construct examples
      of self-covering manifolds which are not fiber bundle over the circle, where 
      the fundamental group contains torsion.

      Title: The group of quasi-isometries of the line cannot act effectively on the 
      line
    
      Abstract: Let G be the group of orientation-preserving quasi-isometries of the 
      real line. We show that G is left-orderable, but not simple. Moreover, the group
      G cannot act effectively on the real line R.
