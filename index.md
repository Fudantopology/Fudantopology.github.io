      Title: Proper actions of 3-manifold groups on finite product of quasi-trees
    
      Abstract: Let M be a compact, connected, orientable 3-manifold. In this talk,
      I will study when the fundamental group of M acts properly on a finite product 
      of quasi-trees. Our main result is that this is so exactly when M does not 
      contain Sol and Nil geometries. In addition, if there is no $\widetilde{SL(2, \mathbb{R})}$
      geometry either, then the orbital map is a quasi-isometric embedding of $\pi_1(M)$. 
      This is called property (QT) by Bestvina-Bromberg-Fujiwara, who established it for 
      residually finite hyperbolic groups and mapping class groups. The main step of our 
      proof is to show property (QT) for the classes of Croke-Kleiner admissible groups 
      and of  relatively hyperbolic groups under natural assumptions. Accordingly, this 
      yields that graph 3-manifold and mixed 3-manifold groups have property (QT). This 
      represents joint work with N.T. Nguyen and S.Z. Han.

      Title: Mapping class group representations via Heisenberg, Schrödinger and 
      Stone-von Neumann
    
      Abstract: One of the first interesting representations of the braid groups is 
      the Burau representation. It is the first of the family of Lawrence representations, 
      defined topologically by viewing the braid group as the mapping class group of a 
      punctured disc. Famously, the Burau representation is almost never faithful, but 
      the k = 2 Lawrence representation is always faithful: this is a celebrated theorem 
      of Bigelow and Krammer and it implies that braid groups are linear (embed into 
      general linear groups over a field).

      Motivated by this, and by the open question of whether mapping class groups are 
      linear, I will describe recent joint work with Christian Blanchet and Awais Shaukat
      in which we construct analogues of the Lawrence representations for mapping class 
      groups of compact, orientable surfaces. Tools include twisted Borel-Moore homology 
      of configuration spaces, Schrödinger representations of discrete Heisenberg groups 
      and the Stone-von Neumann theorem.

      Title: Distinct distances on hyperbolic surfaces
      Abstract:  Erdős (1946) proposed the question of finding the minimal number of 
      distinct distances among any N points in the plane. Guth-Katz (2015) gave almost
      sharp answer for this question using incidence geometry and polynomial 
      partitioning. We consider this problem in hyperbolic surfaces associated with
      cofinite Fuchsian groups, i.e. the volume of the surface is finite. We prove
      a lower bound of the same strength as Guth-Katz. In particular, for any finite
      index subgroup of the modular group, we extract out the dependence of the implied 
      constant on the index.

       Title: An exhaustion of the sphere complex by finite rigid sets
       Abstract: A subcomplex X < C of a simplicial complex is rigid if every locally 
       injective, simplicial map X \to C arises as the restriction of an automorphism 
       of $C$.  Curve complexes and other surface complexes have been found to exhibit 
       remarkable rigidity properties. Aramayona and Leininger proved that the curve complex 
       of an orientable surface can be written as an increasing union of finite rigid sets. 
       The sphere complex of a connect sum of $n$ copies of S^1 \times S^2 is an analog 
       the curve complex of a surface used in the study of Out(F_n). In this talk I will
       present joint work with C. Leininger where we prove that there is an exhaustion of 
       the sphere complex by finite rigid sets when n >= 3.

       Title: Complex hyperbolic lattices
       Abstract: I will give a survey on recent results about complex hyperbolic lattices. 
       A lattice in a Lie group is a discrete subgroup whose quotient has finite Haar measure.
       In this talk I will concentrate on the Lie group SU(n,1), often restricting to the case 
       where n=2. Elements of this group act as holomorphic isometries of complex hyperbolic 
       space. Roughly speaking, there are four methods of constructing complex hyperbolic 
       lattices. I will discuss how these are related, with particular emphasis on a family 
       of non-arithmetic lattices.

      Title:  Geometric structure of self covering manifolds
    
      Abstract: A topological space is self-covering if the space is a non-trivial
      cover of itself. I will talk about a joint work with Lizhen Qin and Botong 
      Wang on the geometric structure of self-covering manifolds. For example, 
      we show that in dimension >5, a self-covering manifold with infinite cyclic 
      fundamental group is a fiber bundle over the circle. We also construct examples
      of self-covering manifolds which are not fiber bundle over the circle, where 
      the fundamental group contains torsion.

      Title: The group of quasi-isometries of the line cannot act effectively on the 
      line
    
      Abstract: Let G be the group of orientation-preserving quasi-isometries of the 
      real line. We show that G is left-orderable, but not simple. Moreover, the group
      G cannot act effectively on the real line R.
