      Title: Mapping class group representations via Heisenberg, Schrödinger and 
      Stone-von Neumann
    
      Abstract: One of the first interesting representations of the braid groups is 
      the Burau representation. It is the first of the family of Lawrence representations, 
      defined topologically by viewing the braid group as the mapping class group of a 
      punctured disc. Famously, the Burau representation is almost never faithful, but 
      the k = 2 Lawrence representation is always faithful: this is a celebrated theorem 
      of Bigelow and Krammer and it implies that braid groups are linear (embed into 
      general linear groups over a field).

      Motivated by this, and by the open question of whether mapping class groups are 
      linear, I will describe recent joint work with Christian Blanchet and Awais Shaukat
      in which we construct analogues of the Lawrence representations for mapping class 
      groups of compact, orientable surfaces. Tools include twisted Borel-Moore homology 
      of configuration spaces, Schrödinger representations of discrete Heisenberg groups 
      and the Stone-von Neumann theorem.

      Title:  Geometric structure of self covering manifolds
    
      Abstract: A topological space is self-covering if the space is a non-trivial
      cover of itself. I will talk about a joint work with Lizhen Qin and Botong 
      Wang on the geometric structure of self-covering manifolds. For example, 
      we show that in dimension >5, a self-covering manifold with infinite cyclic 
      fundamental group is a fiber bundle over the circle. We also construct examples
      of self-covering manifolds which are not fiber bundle over the circle, where 
      the fundamental group contains torsion.

      Title: The group of quasi-isometries of the line cannot act effectively on the 
      line
    
      Abstract: Let G be the group of orientation-preserving quasi-isometries of the 
      real line. We show that G is left-orderable, but not simple. Moreover, the group
      G cannot act effectively on the real line R.
