      Title: Proper actions of 3-manifold groups on finite product of quasi-trees
    
      Abstract: Let M be a compact, connected, orientable 3-manifold. In this talk,
      I will study when the fundamental group of M acts properly on a finite product 
      of quasi-trees. Our main result is that this is so exactly when M does not 
      contain Sol and Nil geometries. In addition, if there is no $\widetilde{SL(2, \mathbb{R})}$
      geometry either, then the orbital map is a quasi-isometric embedding of $\pi_1(M)$. 
      This is called property (QT) by Bestvina-Bromberg-Fujiwara, who established it for 
      residually finite hyperbolic groups and mapping class groups. The main step of our 
      proof is to show property (QT) for the classes of Croke-Kleiner admissible groups 
      and of  relatively hyperbolic groups under natural assumptions. Accordingly, this 
      yields that graph 3-manifold and mixed 3-manifold groups have property (QT). This 
      represents joint work with N.T. Nguyen and S.Z. Han.

      Title: Mapping class group representations via Heisenberg, Schrödinger and 
      Stone-von Neumann
    
      Abstract: One of the first interesting representations of the braid groups is 
      the Burau representation. It is the first of the family of Lawrence representations, 
      defined topologically by viewing the braid group as the mapping class group of a 
      punctured disc. Famously, the Burau representation is almost never faithful, but 
      the k = 2 Lawrence representation is always faithful: this is a celebrated theorem 
      of Bigelow and Krammer and it implies that braid groups are linear (embed into 
      general linear groups over a field).

      Motivated by this, and by the open question of whether mapping class groups are 
      linear, I will describe recent joint work with Christian Blanchet and Awais Shaukat
      in which we construct analogues of the Lawrence representations for mapping class 
      groups of compact, orientable surfaces. Tools include twisted Borel-Moore homology 
      of configuration spaces, Schrödinger representations of discrete Heisenberg groups 
      and the Stone-von Neumann theorem.

      Title: Distinct distances on hyperbolic surfaces
      
      Abstract:  Erdős (1946) proposed the question of finding the minimal number of 
      distinct distances among any N points in the plane. Guth-Katz (2015) gave almost
      sharp answer for this question using incidence geometry and polynomial 
      partitioning. We consider this problem in hyperbolic surfaces associated with
      cofinite Fuchsian groups, i.e. the volume of the surface is finite. We prove
      a lower bound of the same strength as Guth-Katz. In particular, for any finite
      index subgroup of the modular group, we extract out the dependence of the implied 
      constant on the index.

       Title: An exhaustion of the sphere complex by finite rigid sets
       
       Abstract: A subcomplex X < C of a simplicial complex is rigid if every locally 
       injective, simplicial map X \to C arises as the restriction of an automorphism 
       of $C$.  Curve complexes and other surface complexes have been found to exhibit 
       remarkable rigidity properties. Aramayona and Leininger proved that the curve complex 
       of an orientable surface can be written as an increasing union of finite rigid sets. 
       The sphere complex of a connect sum of $n$ copies of S^1 \times S^2 is an analog 
       the curve complex of a surface used in the study of Out(F_n). In this talk I will
       present joint work with C. Leininger where we prove that there is an exhaustion of 
       the sphere complex by finite rigid sets when n >= 3.

       Title: Fibrations on higher-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds
       
       Abstract: One of the most intriguing aspects in low-dimensional topology is the 
       existence, discovered by Jorgensen in the late 70s, of hyperbolic 3-manifolds that
       fiber over the circle. In this talk we will briefly review some aspects of this 
       beautiful theory, with the notable contributions of Thurston, and more recently 
       of Agol and Wise. 

       Then we will show that this phenomenon is not restricted to dimension 3, by 
       exhibiting some examples in dimension 4 and 5 (in even dimension, some critical 
       points are necessary, and we talk about perfect circle valued Morse functions 
       instead of fibrations). As a consequence, we will deduce that a finite type subgroup
       of a hyperbolic group needs not to be hyperbolic, thus answering a well-known open
       question in geometric group theory (joint works with Battista, Italiano, 
       and Migliorini)

     Title: Complex hyperbolic lattices
       
     Abstract: I will give a survey on recent results about complex hyperbolic lattices. 
     A lattice in a Lie group is a discrete subgroup whose quotient has finite Haar measure.
     In this talk I will concentrate on the Lie group SU(n,1), often restricting to the case 
     where n=2. Elements of this group act as holomorphic isometries of complex hyperbolic 
     space. Roughly speaking, there are four methods of constructing complex hyperbolic 
     lattices. I will discuss how these are related, with particular emphasis on a family 
     of non-arithmetic lattices.

  Title: Large-scale geometry of the saddle connection graph
  
  Abstract: For a translation surface, the associated saddle connection graph has saddle 
  connections as vertices, and edges connecting pairs of non-crossing saddle connections. 
  This can be viewed as an induced subgraph of the arc graph of the surface. In this talk,
  I will discuss both the fine and coarse geometry of the saddle connection graph. We show
  that the isometry type is rigid: any isomorphism between two such graphs is induced by 
  an affine diffeomorphism between the underlying translation surfaces. However, the 
  situation is completely different when one considers the quasi-isometry type: all 
  saddle connection graphs form a single quasi-isometry class. We will also discuss 
  the Gromov boundary in terms of foliations. This is based on joint work with Valentina
  Disarlo, Huiping Pan, and Anja Randecker.

  Title: Choosing points on cubic plane curves 
  
  Abstract: It is a classical topic to study structures of certain special points on
  smooth complex cubic plane curves, for example, the 9 flex points and the 27 sextactic
  points. We consider the following topological question asked by Farb: Is it true 
  that the known algebraic structures give all the possible ways to continuously 
  choose n distinct points on every smooth cubic plane curve, for each given integer
  n? This work is joint with Ishan Banerjee.

       Title: Cohomological properties of Mackey functors for totally disconnected locally compact groups
   
       Abstract: Mackey functors for finite groups are well understood. In the early
       2000s this was extended to infinite discrete groups, and their cohomological 
       finiteness conditions have been expressed in terms of relative cohomology and 
       finiteness conditions of          classifying spaces for proper actions. In 
       this talk I will indicate how one can extend the definition to totally 
       disconnected groups, and will indicate some of the obstacles encountered 
       here. This is ongoing work with Ilaria Castellano and Nadia Mazza.

       Title: Typical behavior of random mapping classes and outer automorphisms
       
       Abstract: Random walks on spaces that manifest hyperbolic properties
       have been studied for decades, as a means to investigate the structure of
       the isometry groups of such spaces. Notable results in this topic include
       descriptions of generic random isometries and limit laws for displacements
       and translation lengths. A recent technique called the pivoting technique
       led to further elaborations in these directions. In this talk, I will describe
       properties of generic random isometries of Teichmuller space or Outer
       space. Namely, generic mapping classes are principal pseudo-Anosovs that
       make displacements with many contracting subsegments. This frequently
       contracting property is shared with generic outer automorphisms, which
       are ageometric fully irreducibles and whose expansion factors differ from
       their inverses'. If time permits, I will explain how this description is related
       to (1) Qing-Rafi's sublinearly Mosre boundaries and (2) limit laws for
       random 3-manifolds.

       Title: Homomorphisms to 3-manifold groups 

       Abstract: Following Sela's theory of limit groups (of free group), we define
       and study limit groups of compact 3-manifold groups. We show that the family 
       of compact 3-manifold groups are equationally noetherian, which answers a 
       question of Agol and Liu.  The main application of our result is to give a 
       positive answer to a question of Reid, Wang and Zhou about epimorphism 
       sequence of closed orientable aspherical 3-manifold groups. This is joint work
       with Daniel Groves and Michael Hull.

     to G. In this talk, I will focus on the group theoretic side of this result
     and talk about how we applied geometric group theory to solve problems from

      Wang on the geometric structure of self-covering manifolds. For example, 
      we show that in dimension >5, a self-covering manifold with infinite cyclic 
      fundamental group is a fiber bundle over the circle. We also construct examples
      of self-covering manifolds which are not fiber bundle over the circle, where 
      the fundamental group contains torsion.
