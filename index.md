  Title: Introduction to topological full groups

  Abstract: In this mini-course, we will introduce various properties and examples of
  topological full groups, which are discrete groups naturally associated with etale
   groupoids whose unit spaces are Cantor sets. Over the past two decades, these groups
   have been extensively studied and are now known to exhibit a rich array of features,
   such as simplicity, amenability, and finite generation, making them central objects
   at the intersection of group theory, topology, and operator algebras. 

   Starting from the definition of topological full groups, we will discuss basic examples
  arising from minimal Z-actions and AF groupoids. We will also explain the connections
  to groupoid homology, and the reconstruction theorem which claims the group structure of
  the topological full group remembers the groupoid itself.
  
  A significant part of the theory revolves around the dichotomy of ample groupoids into
  two classes: almost finite and purely infinite groupoids. With this distinction in mind,
  we will discuss structural results such as simplicity of the commutator subgroup, amenability,
  and finite generation of topological full groups. Depending on time constraints, we may select
  certain topics to discuss in more detail.

  Title: 	A weight-free characterisation for yu’s property A

  Abstract: The notion of Property A was introduced by G. Yu as a coarseanalogue of amenability,
   which plays a key role to attack the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture. In his original definition,
   the family of Property A sets of a metric space X are allowed to taken in X\times\mathbb{N}.
  We show that the Property A sets can indeed be chosenin X itself for any discrete metric space of
  bounded geometry. Thekey idea is to use a smearing map, inspired fromuniformlyfinitehomology introduced
   by Block and Weinberger. This is a joint workwith G. Niblo, N. Wright and J. Zhu.

  Title: Straightening structures on surfaces

  Abstract: Triangulations are ubiquitous throughout low-dimensional topology and geometry.
  It is a well-known result that any two triangulations of a topological surface are related
  by a finite sequence of flips. The analogous result is also known to be true for geometric
  triangulations for surfaces equipped with certain geometric structures, for example,
  Euclidean cone metrics or hyperbolic surfaces with a fixed vertex set. However, the
  prevailing methods for studying triangulations and flip sequences, in the geometric
  setting, tend to be very specific to the type of geometry involved.

  In this talk, I will introduce straightening structures on surfaces. This provides an
  axiomatic framework which models the behaviour of geodesic paths on non-positively
  curved surfaces. Moreover, it permits a notion of 'straight triangulation',
  generalising the geometric triangulations from the Euclidean or hyperbolic settings.
   Our main result is that the 'straight flip graph' associated to a straightening
  structure is non-empty, connected, and quasi-isometrically embedded in the flip
   graph of the underlying topological surface. I will also describe other classes
  of geometric structures that give rise to straightening structures.

  This is joint work with Valentina Disarlo.

  Abstract: In this talk, we will discuss the actions of the fundamental group

  such group actions, we provide a family of examples of fundamental groups of
  graph of groups that are C*-simple. This is joint work with Xin Ma and
  Wenyuan Yang.

  Title: Equators of the 2-sphere and area-preserving homeomorphisms

  Abstract: The curve complex is an important tool in the study of mapping
  class groups of surfaces, and other areas of low-dimensional topology
  such as Teichmueller space and hyperbolic 3-manifolds. In this talk,
  we introduce analogues of the curve complex in order to study the group
  of area-preserving homeomorphisms (or Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms) of
  the 2-sphere. How this relates to the dynamics of area-preserving
  homeomorphisms, and symplectic geometry, is particularly curious,
   especially because the original curve complex tells us lots of information
   about the dynamics of mapping classes of surfaces. Using our tools, we are
   able to construct new quasimorphisms on the group(s) above. I will discuss
   an application of this regarding the geometry of simple closed curves that
   separate the sphere into two components of equal area (i.e. equators of the
  sphere), and how this relates to the Equator Conjecture. Joint work with
  Yongsheng Jia.

  Title: Shape of Thurston’s filling systole subset in surface moduli space

  Abstract: In this talk, I am going to talk about the sparseness of Thurston's subset.
  Sparseness is a geometric concept on Thurston's subset first raised by Anderson-Parlier-Pettet
   in 2016. We have proved the sparseness of Thurston's subset in the sense of Teichmüller
  distance and Weil-Petersson distance. More precisely, most surfaces in genus g surface
  moduli space have Teichmüller distance $\frac{1}{5}\log\log g$ and Weil-Petersson
  distance $0.6521(\sqrt{\log g}−\sqrt{7\log\log g})$ to the Thurston's subset.

  Title: CAT(0) Geometry of Complex Curve Complements and Families

  Abstract: Motivated by the question of whether braid groups are CAT(0),
  we investigate the CAT(0) behavior of fundamental groups of plane curve
  complements and certain universal families. If C is the branch locus of a
  generic projection of a smooth, complete intersection surface to P^2 , we
  show that the fundamental group of P^2 ∖ C is CAT(0). In the other
  direction, we prove that the fundamental group of the universal family
  associated with the singularities of type E6, E7, and E8 is not CAT(0). This
  is joint work with C. Bregman and A. Libgober.

  Title: Minimal Surfaces in Negative Curvature

  Abstract: It follows from work by Kahn-Markovic that every closed negatively
   curved 3-manifold contains essential minimal surfaces in great abundance.
   Since then the goal of better understanding these minimal surfaces has been
   a focus of activity, both in analogy to the geodesic flow one dimension lower
   and the more positive-curvature-centric min-max theory of minimal surfaces.
    This talk will survey recent developments in this area, which brings together
   techniques from dynamical systems, geometric analysis, and hyperbolic geometry.

  Title: Limits of asymptotically Fuchsian surfaces in a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold

  Abstract: Let M be a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold and let Gr(M) be its 2-plane
  Grassmann bundle. We will discuss the following result: the weak-* limits of the
   probability area measures on Gr(M) of pleated or minimal closed connected
  essential K-quasifuchsian surfaces as K goes to 1 are all convex combinations
  of the probability area measures of the immersed closed totally geodesic surfaces
  of M and the probability volume (Haar) measure of Gr(M).

  Title: Nonpositively curved 4-manifolds with zero Euler characteristic

  Abstract: The well-known Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem shows that the Euler
   characteristic of a closed nonpositively curved 4-manifolds is always
  nonnegative. In this talk, I will present a geometric characterization
  of the equality case--at each point, it is either Ricci degenerate or
  locally foliated by totally geodesic flats. I'll also mention the connection
   to Gromov's two conjectures regarding on simplicial volume. This is joint
  work with Chris Connell and Yuping Ruan.

  Title: Embedding groups into simple groups

  Abstract:  Simple groups has played an important role in the studying of groups.
   The  Boone-Higman Conjecture says a finitely generated group can be embedded
  into a finitely presented simple group if and only if  it has solvable word
  problem. The conjecture has now been proved for many classes of groups,
  including hyperbolic groups, RAAGs and linear groups over the rationals.
  In this talk, we will first give an overview of the conjecture. Then we
  discuss a strategy that can be used to embed groups acting faithfully on
   locally finite trees to finitely presented simple groups. In particular
   we verify the conjecture for the Baumslag-Solitar groups and free-by-cyclic
   groups. The talk is based on a joint work with Kai-Uwe Bux and Claudio
  Llosa Isenrich.

  Title: Some results in non-simply connected rational homotopy theory

  Abstract: Certain statements that are straightforward in simply connected
   rational homotopy theory become surprisingly subtle for the non-simply
  connected case and remain open problems. In this talk I will address two
   such questions: first, proving that minimal Sullivan model realizations
   still preserve rational cohomology in the non-simply connected setting;
  second, establishing an upper bound for the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category
   of a relative Sullivan algebra in terms of the LS categories of its base
  algebra and fiber algebra.

  Title: Some Gromoll filtration groups and homotopy groups of diffeomorphism groups

  Abstract: In 1964, Gromoll gave a filtration of the group of homotopy n+1-spheres for n>5
  and connected this filtration to the pinching of homotopy spheres. On the other hand, this
   filtration is closely related to homotopy groups of diffeomorphism groups of smooth
  manifolds.

   In this talk, we will first give some background on Gromoll filtration groups and
   diffeomorphism groups from a topological point of view. Then we will introduce some
  methods of calculation and give our recent results. We will also discuss some further
  applications to certain smooth fibre bundles.

  Title: Geometric invariants for locally compact groups

  Abstract: The features of a group being finitely generated or finitely presented
  are, respectively, the n=1
  and n=2 cases of the finiteness property F_n. Towards the end of the
  last century, the question of
  when these finiteness conditions descend to subgroups of G led to the
  discovery of the sets
  Sigma^n(G) (and their homological counterparts Sigma^n(G;A), for A a
  Z[G]-module). Each set
  Sigma^n(G) is a collection of homomorphisms G --> R, refining property
  F_n in the sense that G has
  type F_n precisely if Sigma^n(G) contains the zero map. In the
  literature, Sigma-sets are also
  often called BNSR-invariants, due to Bieri, Neumann, Strebel and Renz,
  who pioneered the theory.

  Another direction in which to generalize finiteness properties is to
  consider groups G with a
  locally compact Hausdorff topology. In that setting, Abels and Tiemeyer
  introduced the compactness
  properties C_n, which specialize to F_n for G discrete (though this fact
  is far from obvious at a
  first glance). In joint work with Kai-Uwe Bux and Elisa Hartmann, we
  have refined these properties
  C_n to sets Sigma^n(G), with our definition recovering the classical
  Sigma sets in the discrete
  case. We have also generalized various results of classical Sigma-theory
  to the setting of locally
  compact groups. In my talk, I will give an introduction to the theory of
  Sigma sets and explain
  some of these results.

  Title: Extensive Computations Of the Adams Spectral Sequence E_2-Pages at Odd Primes

  Abstract:  In this talk, I will present joint work with Weinan Lin that overcomes
  fundamental computational limitations in computing the E 2-page ofthe Adams spectral
  sequence at odd primes
Leveraging a novel generalization of Grobner basis theory, we develop an eflicient
framework that allows us to determine complete additive and multiplicative structures
in significantly larger degree ranges than previously possible. Notably, our method
achieves these results in practical time frames. circumventing the rapid growth inherent in carlier techniques.
These advances not only advance thealgorithmic toolkit for spectral sequences but also lay
the groundwork for targeted investigations into stable homotopy groups of spheres and
related spectra.

  Title: Some progress on geometric ideal triangulation

  Abstract:  Gluing ideal tetrahedra plays a crucial role in the construction of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.
   It is still not known that whether a hyperbolic 3-manifold admits a geometric ideal triangulation.
   In this talk, I will show some progress to hyperbolize and further obtain geometric triangulations of
   3-manifolds. I will show the rigidity of hyperbolic polyhedral metrics on 3-manifolds, and the connections
   between 3D-combinatorial Ricci flows and Thurston's geometric ideal triangulations, which is a joint work
  with Huabin Ge. Further, I will show a new existence result of the geometric ideal triangulation which is a
  joint work with Huabin Ge and Yunpeng Meng.

  Title: The L^2 Alexander torsion for 3-manifolds and sutured manifold theory

  Abstract: The L^2-Alexander torsion is an invariant associated to a 3-manifold and an 1-cohomology class.
   This invariant is a real function with many properties similar to the classical Alexander polynomial.
  In this talk, I will first review the basics of L^2-theory of 3-manifolds (e.g. L^2-betti numbers, L^2-torsions),
  then discuss the "leading coefficient" of the L^2-Alexander torsion and show its connection with Gabai's sutured manifold
  theory and the guts theory recently developed by Agol-Zhang.

  Title: Non Vanishing of the Fourth Bounded Cohomology of Free Groups and Codimension 2 Subspaces

  Abstract: Bounded cohomology is a powerful albeit very hard to compute invariant. Nothing encapsulates that
   more than the as of yet mysterious bounded cohomology of free groups. During this talk I will give a very
  brief introduction to bounded cohomology, further motivate why one should care about the bounded cohomology
  of free groups and then explain how to show that it is non-zero in degrees two, three and four.

  Title: Subgroups of Genus-2 Quasi-Fuchsian groups and Cocompact Kleinian Groups

  Abstract: Kahn and Markovic proved the Surface Subgroup Conjecture for compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds over
  a decade ago, constructing surface subgroups that can be nearly Fuchsian. However, a compact hyperbolic
   3-manifold may also contain surface subgroups that are significantly not totally geodesic. We extend
  this by showing that given any genus-2 quasi-Fuchsian group Γ and any cocompact Kleinian group G, for
   any K>1, there exists a surface subgroup H of G that is K-quasiconformally conjugate to a finite
  index subgroup F<Γ. As an application, we demonstrate that the Hausdorff dimensions of the limit
   sets of surface subgroups of G are dense in the interval [1,2].

  Title: Uniqueness and non-uniqueness for the Asymptotic Plateau Problem in hyperbolic three-space.
  Abstract: The Asymptotic Plateau Problem in the hyperbolic space is the problem of existence of
  minimal surfaces with a prescribed Jordan curve as a boundary “at infinity”. Since the work
  of Anderson in the 1980s, it is known to have a solution, which is however in general not
  unique. In this talk, I will give an overview of the subject, present examples of
  “pathological” non-uniqueness, and describe some criteria for uniqueness.

  Title: Figure-eight knot is always over there

  Abstract:It is well known that the complex hyperbolic triangle group $\Delta(3,3,4)$  generated
   by three  complex  reflections $I_1,I_2,I_3$ in $\mathbf{PU}(2,1)$  has a 1-dimensional moduli
  space. Deforming the representations from the classical  real Fuchsian one to $\Delta(3,3,4; \infty)$,
  that is, when $I_3I_2I_1I_2$ is accidental parabolic, the 3-manifolds at infinity change,  from
   a Seifert 3-manifold to the  figure-eight knot complement.

  When $I_3I_2I_1I_2$ is loxodromic, there is an open set $\Omega \subset \partial \mathbf{H}^2_{\mathbb C}=
  \mathbb S^3$ associated to $I_3I_2I_1I_2$, which is a subset of the  discontinuous region. We 
  show the quotient space $\Omega/ \Delta(3,3,4)$ is always the figure-eight knot complement in
  the deformation process. This gives the topological/geometrical explanation that the 3-manifold
  at infinity of $\Delta(3,3,4; \infty)$ is the figure-eight knot complement. In particular, this
  confirms the conjecture of Falbel-Guilloux-Will.   This is joint work with Baohua Xie.

  In addition, after briefly introducing topological entropy, I will discuss how to generalize 
  one of the existing results of entropy conjecture, relaxing the smooth manifold restrictions 
  on the compact metric spaces, by using lc-homology groups. This is joint work with Bingzhe

 allowingtheclassical multiplicative infinite loop machine to be appliedtoalgebras over any E_\infty 
 ring operad. As an application, we showthat classifying spaces of symmetric bimonoidal categories
 are directlyhomeomorphic to certain  E_\infty ring spaces in the ring operadsense. Consequently,
 this provides a simpler construction of the algebraicK-theory as an E_\infty ring spectra.

 Title: Relative Bounded Cohomology on Groups with Contracting Elements

 Abstract: Let $G$ be a countable group acting properly on a metric spacewith contracting elements 
 and $\{H_i:1\le i\le n\}$ be a finite collection of Morse subgroups in $G$. We prove that each 
 $H_i$ has infinite index in $G$ if and only if the relative second boundedcohomology
 $H^{2}_b(G, \{H_i\}_{i=1}^n; \mathbb{R})$is infinite-dimensional. In addition, we 
 also prove that for any contracting element $g$, there exists $k>0$ such that 
 $H^{2}_b(G, \llangle g^k\rrangle; \mathbb{R})$ is infinite-dimensional. Our 
 results generalize a theorem of Pagliantini-Rolli for finite-rank free groups and 
 produce some new results on the (relative) second bounded cohomology of groups. 
 Under the same conditions, we also prove a Gap Theorem stating that any $C$-contracting
 element $g$ in $G$ either has a power which is conjugate to its inverse, or else the
 stable commutator length of $g$ is at least equal to some constant $\tau=\tau(C)>0$.
 This generalizes the Gap Theorem obtained by Calegari-Fujiwara for hyperbolic groups 
 and mapping class groups. Joint work with Renxing Wan.

  Title: Patterson-Sullivan measures for relative Anosov groups

  Abstract: Relative Anosov groups are a class of subgroups of a semisimple Lie group G
   that include all Anosov subgroups, and all geometrically finite subgroups when G has
   rank one. We prove that under some mild conditions on G, the Poincare series associated
   to a relative Anosov subgroup (and a linear function on the Cartan subspace of G) diverges
   at its critical exponent if its critical exponent is finite. As a consequence of this,
  we deduce uniqueness and ergodicity results for the associated Patterson-Sullivan measure
   whose dimension is the critical exponent. This is joint work with Richard Canary and
  Andrew Zimmer.

 Title: This talk presents a study of the well-known marked length spectrum rigidity 
 problem in the coarse-geometric setting. 
 
 For any two (possibly non-proper) group
 actions $G\curvearrowright
 X_1$ and $G\curvearrowright X_2$ with contracting property, 
 we prove that if the two actions have the same marked length spectrum,
 then the orbit map $Go_1\to Go_2$ must be a rough isometry. In addition,
 we prove a finer marked length spectrum rigidity from confined subgroups and
 further, geometrically dense subgroups. Our proof is based on the Extension
 Lemma and uses purely elementary metric geometry. This is joint work with 
 Xiaoyu Xu and Wenyuan Yang.

Title: Length bounds for hyperbolic Heegaard splittings

Abstract: In theory, by Mostow rigidity, the geometry of a hyperbolic 3-manifold is
a function of its topology, but how to predict explicitly geometric features from a
combinatorial presentation of the 3-manifold? By groundbreaking work of Minsky and 
Brock, Canary, and Minsky such a formula exists for the class of hyperbolic 3-manifolds
fibering over the circle. Their model allows to understand explicitly quantities such 
as volume, length spectrum, and Laplace spectrum directly from topological data. It 
is desirable to develop a similar picture for Heegaard splittings as it would apply 
to all 3-manifolds. In this talk, I will present some joint work with Alessandro 
SIsto and Peter Feller where we develop an explicit purely topological formula for
the length of a (short) geodesic in a hyperbolic Heegaard splitting.

  Abstract: Groups of intermediate growth has been an active researchtopic in geometric

  of such a group, namely, the Grigorchuk group. In this talk, I will describe a new class
  of groups of intermediate growth. I will define the class of groups of bounded type from
   tile inflations, and show that if the set ofincompressible elements of a group in this

 Tilte: Minimal Surface Entropy of Hyperbolic Manifolds 

 Abstract: I will discuss the definition of minimal surface entropy and review the results
 for both closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds and the finite volume case. On one hand, for metrics
 with sectional curvature no greater than -1, the entropy achieves its minimum value if 
 and only if it is hyperbolic. On the other hand, among all metrics with scalar curvature

  admit globally stable cylindres. I will discuss recent work with Petyt-Spriano
   were we show that all residually finite hyperbolic groups admit such.

  Title: Dehn functions of central products of nilpotent groups

  Abstract: The Dehn function of a finitely presented group provides a quantitative measure
   for the difficulty of detecting if a word in its generators represents the trivial element
   of the group. By work of Gersten, Holt and Riley the Dehn function of a nilpotent group of
   class c is bounded above by n^{c+1}. However, we are still far from determining the
   precise Dehn functions of all nilpotent groups. In this talk, I will explain recent results
   that allow us to determine the Dehn functions of large classes of nilpotent groups arising
   as central products. As a consequence, for every k>2, we obtain many pairs of finitely
   presented k-nilpotent groups with bilipschitz asymptotic cones, but with different Dehn
   functions. This shows that Dehn functions can distinguish between nilpotent groups with the
   same asymptotic cone, making them interesting in the context of the conjectural quasi-isometry
   classification of nilpotent groups.  This talk is based on joint works with García-Mejía,
   Pallier and Tessera.

  Title: Telling groups apart by measures of complexity

  Abstract:  It is hopeless to classify infinite groups up to isomorphism. 
  There are several invariants one can use to chart the vast area 
  inhabited by such groups. I shall discuss several numerical group 
  invariants coming from topology, homology, and geometry:

         * finiteness properties
         * (co)homologicial and geometric dimensions
         * isoperimetric inequalities

  I shall illustrate these concepts by means of examples; and the main 
  source of examples for groups in this talk will be arithmetic groups, 
  e.g., the group of invertible integer n-by-n matrices.

  Title: Profinite rigidity of the multivariable Alexander polynomials of links

  Abstract: The profinite completion of a group encodes the set of all finite quotients
   of the group. An interesting question in low dimensional topology is what kind of
   properties of a 3-manifold can be determined by the profinite completion of its
  fundamental group. In 2018, Ueki showed that for a knot in $S^3$, the Alexander
  polynomial of the knot is determined by the profinite completion of its knot group.
  For a link in $S^3$, one would like to know if the multivariable Alexander polynomial
   is also determined by its link group. In this talk, I will explain why this question
  is complicated and report some results on what we know. This talk is based on an ongoing
  joint work with Jun Ueki.

  contact 3-sphere  along any Legendrian positive torus knot with the maximal Thurston–Bennequin
  invariant yields an algebraically overtwisted and tight 3-manifold, where k is a positive
  integer. This is joint work with Zhengyi Zhou.

  Abstract: Median spaces have garnered attention in the field of geometric group
  theory due to the characterization that they give to the Kazhdan property (T)
  and to the Haagerup property. They also give a common framework for studying
  isometric actions on R-trees and CAT(0) cube complexes. In the first part of

  Title: Topological Hochschild homology and Prismatic Cohomology 

  Abstract: The theory of prismatic cohomology is a universal p-adic cohomology theory, in
  the sense that it specializes to the classical p-adic cohomology theories such as the de
  Rham  cohomology and the p-adic etale cohomology. Originally, this universal p-adic
  cohomology theory was expected by the calculation of topological Hochschild homology
  for (integral) perfectoid rings. In this seminar, the basic ideas of prismatic cohomology
  and topological Hochschild homology will be introduced, and between which the delicate
  interconnection will be emphasized. Especially the general theory of relative topological
  Hochschild homology and the phenomena of Bokstedt periodicity, which might benefit the
  calculation of (absolute) topological cyclic homology through the descent technique,
  are to be discussed.

  Title:  A general version of Kaplansky‘s direct-finiteness conjecture 

  Abstract: The classical Kaplansky’s direct-finiteness conjecture says that if a, b are two elements of
  a group ring KG for a filed K and a group G satisfying that ab=1, then ba=1. Kaplansky proves the case
  that K is a field of characteristic zero and G is any group. Joint with Hanfeng Li, we prove a general
  case that K is replaced with a left Noetherian unital ring R and G is a sofic group. The tools of the
  this proof are refined mean length functions defined on the RG-modules in connection with some category
  language

  Abstract: In this talk we show that, the loop space X of a graph product of spaces is given by
   (up to weak homotopy equivalence of topological monoids) a graph product of simplicial
  groups, using Kan’s construction of loop spaces on simplicial sets. As a consequence, we
   obtain a theorem of Dobrinskaya: when X is connected, its homology (with coefficients
  from a field) is a graph product H of connected Hopf algebras. Some properties of the
  commutator of H will also be discussed.

  Title:  Cayley graphs with few automorphisms

  Abstract: Let G be a group and S a generating set. Then the group G naturally acts on the
   Cayley graph Cay(G,S) by left multiplications. The group G is said to be rigid if there
  exists an S such that the only automorphisms of Cay(G,S) are the ones coming from the action
  of G. Equivalently, a group G is rigid if there exists a graph X with G=Aut(X) acting simply
   transitively on the vertices of X. While the classification of finite rigid groups was
  achieved in 1981, few results were known about infinite groups. In a recent work, with M.
  de la Salle we gave a complete classification of infinite finitely generated rigid groups.
  As a consequence, we also obtain that every finitely generated group admits a Cayley graph
  with countable automorphism group.

   Title: Equivalent Curves on Surfaces

   Abstract: We consider a closed oriented surface of genus at least 2. To describe curves
  on it, one natural idea is to choose once for all a collection of curves as a reference
   system and to hope that any other curve can be determined by its intersection numbers
  with reference curves. For simple curves, using the work of Dehn and Thurston, it is possible
   to find such a reference system consisting of finitely many simple curves. The situation
   becomes more complicated when curves have self-intersections. In particular, for any non-negative
   integer k, it is possible to find a pair of curves having the same intersection number with
  every curve with k self-intersections. Such a pair of curves are called k-equivalent curves.
  In this talk, I will discuss the general picture of a pair of k-equivalent curves and the
   relation between k-equivalence relations for different k's. This is a joint-work with Hugo
   Parlier.

   Title: Equivariant formality of homogeneous spaces

   Abstract: Equivariant formality, a notion in equivariant topology introduced by
  Goresky-Kottwitz-Macpherson, is a desirable property of spaces with group actions.
  Broad classes of spaces of especial interest are well-known to be equivariantly formal,
   e.g., compact symplectic manifolds equipped with Hamiltonian compact Lie group actions
   and projective varieties equipped with linear algebraic torus actions, of which flag varieties
   are examples. Less is known about compact homogeneous spaces G/K equipped with the isotropy
  action of K, which is not necessarily of maximal rank. In this talk we will review the notion
   of equivariant formality and previous attempts of characterizing equivariant formality of G/K,
  and then present our results on this problem using an analogue of equivariant formality in
  K-theory. Part of the work presented in this talk is joint with Jeffrey Carlson.

  Title: Character varieties and skein modules of knot complements

  Abstract: Let $K$ be a knot in $S^3$, and let $\pi(K)$ be the knot group. The character of a
  representation $\rho:\pi(K)\to{\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ is the function $x\mapsto{\rm tr}(\rho(x))$.
  The characters of all representations form the character variety $X(K)$, which is known to encode
  much topological information on $S^3\setminus K$. Fix a commutative ring $R$ with a distinguished
  invertible element $A$. The Kauffman bracket skein module $S(K)$ is defined as the $R$-module
  generated by embedded framed  links in $S^3\setminus K$ modulo certain local relations. The skein
  module encodes more information,  and is regarded as a quantization of character variety, in the
  sense that $S(K)$ recovers $X(K)$ when $R=\mathbb{C}$ and $A=-1$. Based on recent works, we will
  talk about the following interrelated topics: (1) computing $X(K)$ for arborescent knots $K$;
  (2) high-dimensional components of $X(K)$, i.e. those $C$ with $\dim C>1$; (3)
  torsion in $S(K)$ when $K$ is a Montesinos knot.

  Title: Quasi-isometric rigidity for a product of lattices
  
  Abstract: Quasi-isometric rigidity theorems contribute to Gromov's program of classifying 
  finitely generated groups up to quasi-isometry. In this talk we discuss the quasi-isometric
  rigidity for the class of groups N x L, where N is a lattice in a simply connected nilpotent
  Lie group and L is a non-uniform lattice in a rank one semisimple Lie group. Such a group is,
  up to finite noise, an extension by a nilpotent lattice of a non-uniform lattice commensurable
  to L. This is the first step towards proving quasi-isometric rigidity for a class of spaces 
  generalizing high-dimensional graph manifolds, as defined by Frigerio-Lafont-Sisto.

  algebraic integers in Q(i√d) has class number one, i.e. d=1,2,3,7,11,19,43,67,163. The 
  computations can be performed quickly up to the value d=19. As an application of this 
  method, we classify conjugacy classes of torsion elements, deduce short presentations 
  for the groups, and construct neat subgroups of small index. This is joint work with

  Title: Computing high-dimensional group cohomology via duality
  
  Abstract: In recent years, duality approaches have yielded new results about the 
  high-dimensional cohomology of several groups and moduli spaces, such as SL<sub>n</sub>(<b>Z</b>) 
  and M<sub>g</sub>. I will explain the general strategy of these approaches and survey 
  results that have been obtained so far.

  To give an example, I will first explain how Borel-Serre duality can be used to show that
  the rational cohomology of SL<sub>n</sub>(<b>Z</b>) vanishes near its virtual cohomological
  dimension. This is based on joint work with Miller-Patzt-Sroka-Wilson and builds on results
  by Church-Farb-Putman.
  
  I will then put this into a more general context by giving an overview of analogous results
  for mapping class groups of surfaces, automorphism groups of free groups and further 
  arithmetic groups such as SL<sub>n</sub>(O<sub>K</sub>) and Sp<sub>2n</sub>(<b>Z</b>).

  Title: The earthquake metric
  
  Abstract: Earthquakes are natural generalisations of Fenchel-Nielsen twists deformations
  on Teichmueller space, and Thurston’s remarkable earthquake theorem asserts that any 
  hyperbolic metric on a given closed surface can be deformed to any other by a unique 
  (left) earthquake. This was famously employed by Kerckhoff in his proof of the Nielsen
  realisation problem, which quickly cemented their importance in Teichmüller theory. 
  Geometrically speaking, however, (long) Earthquake paths are far from being “twist 
  efficient” - indeed, Mirzakhani shows that earthquake flows on Teichmüller space are
  measure conjugate to the horocyclic flow. Motivated by wishing to understand how one
  might efficiently “earthquake” between hyperbolic structures, we initiate the first 
  systematic study of the earthquake metric—a Finsler metric first introduced in 
  Thurston’s “Minimal stretch maps between hyperbolic surfaces” preprint, and discover
  surprising connections to both the Thurston metric and the Weil-Petersson metric. 
  This is work in collaboration with K. Ohshika, H. Pan and A. Papadopoulos.

  Title: From telescopes to frames and simple groups
  
  Abstract: I will introduce the notion of a telescope of groups. Very roughly a telescope
  is a directed system of groups that contains various commuting images of some fixed group B.
  Imitating known constructions of groups acting on rooted trees, we obtain a number of 
  examples of B-telescopes and discuss several applications.
 
  We give examples of  2-generated  infinite amenable simple groups. We show that every 
  finitely generated residually finite (amenable) group embeds into a finitely generated 
  (amenable) simple LEF-group. We construct 2-generated frames in products of finite simple 
  groups and show that there are Grothendieck pairs consisting of amenable groups and groups 
  with property (tau). This talk is based on a joint work with Steffen Kionke.

   Title: Arithmetic approximate lattices and their finiteness properties
   
   Abstract: Approximate groups were identified as a natural framework for
   geometric group theory by Björklund and Hartnick and further developed
   by Cordes, Hartnick and Tonić, unifying previous research on apparently
   disparate areas such as finite approximate groups (Breuillard, Green,
   Tao) and quasi-crystals (Meyer and others).

   Approximate groups arise naturally via a cut-and-project procedure from
   lattices in locally compact groups. A central point I want to make is
   that S-arithmetic groups are, by their standard definition, the result
   of cut-and-project procedure. They happen to be groups as long as S
   contains all infinite places, an assumption usually imposed.

   In the context of approximate groups, that assumption can be lifted and
   gives rise to S-arithmetic approximate groups in characteristic 0 that
   are not groups but resemble S-arithmetic groups in positive
   characteristic. The finiteness properties of S-arithmetic subgroups of
   reductive groups in positive characteristic are determined by the Rank
   Theorem (joint with Bux and Köhl). I will present joint work with Tobias
   Hartnick proving a Rank Theorem for S-arithmetic approximate groups in
   characteristic 0.

    Title: Intersection of parabolic subgroups in Artin groups
    
    Abstract: Artin groups are a natural generalisation of braid groups from an 
    algebraic point of view: in the same way that braids are obtained from the
    presentation of the symmetric group, other Coxeter groups give rise to more 
    general Artin groups. There are very few results proven for every Artin group. 
    To study them, specialists have focused on some special kind of subgroup, called
    "parabolic subgroups".  These groups are used to build important simplicial complexes,
    as the Deligne complex or the recent complex of irreducible parabolic subgroups. The 
    question "Is the intersection of parabolic subgroups a parabolic subgroup?" is a very
    basic question whose answer was only known for RAAGs until 2018. In this talk, we will
    speak about the progress on that matter since then, starting with the breakthrough of 
    the positive answer for spherical-type Artin groups and we will see how we can answer 
    this question in Artin groups of large type, by using the geometric realisation of the
    poset of parabolic subgroups, that we have named "Artin complex". In particular, we 
    will show that this complex in the large case has a property called sistolicity (a 
    sort of weak CAT(0) property) that allows us to apply techniques from geometric group
    theory. These are a joint works with Volker Gebhardt, Juan González-Meneses, Bert 
    Wiest, Alexandre Martin and Nicolas Vaskou.

  Title: Noncommutative Gröbner basis and Ext groups

  Abstract: The Gröbner basis is a powerful tool in commutative algebra. We can use it to do many 
  calculations such as computing the presentations of the kernel and cokernel of a map between 
  finitely presented modules over a commutative algebra. However, many important algebras including 
  the Steenrod algebra in algebraic topology are not commutative. We make a noncommutative generalization 
  of the Gröbner basis which can be applied to the Steenrod algebra A. This leads to highly efficient
  calculations in the category of A-modules including the computation of E2 pages of Adams spectral
  sequences.

   Abstract: A theorem of Furstenberg from 1967 states that if Gamma is a lattice in a semisimple Lie group 
   G, then there exists a measure on Gamma with finite first moment such that the corresponding harmonic 
   measure on the Furstenberg boundary is absolutely continuous. We will discuss generalizations of this 
   theorem in the setting of the Mapping class group and Gromov hyperbolic groups

   Title: Algebraic Model of Manifolds
   
   Abstract: The surgery theory of dimension at least 5 stayedinthecentral position of classification of
   manifolds in the last century. In1970s, Ranicki invented the cosheaf theory of derived quadraticforms 
   to give an algebraic discription of the existence of highdimensional manifolds over a fixed homotopy
   type andthehomotopy manifold classifications. On the other hand, we couldunderstand a homotopy type
   by passage to rational andp-adicinformation. Quillen and Sullivan individually developedtherational
   homotopy theories. Sullivan sketched the approachtoalgebraize simply connected rational manifolds,
   i.e., a free dgaoverQ together with a Poincare duality and several rational Pontryaginclasses, and 
   Zhixu Su completed the proof in her thesis. About twodecades ago, Mandell proved that E-inifinity 
   algebras over Fp-barcanb be the algebraic models of p-adic nilpotent homotopytypes. Five years ago, 
   Rivera and Zeinalian showed that the cobarconstruction of coalgebras could give algebraic models of
   integral homotopy types. We want to generalize Sullivan's rational discussionof manifolds to give 
   algebraic models of manifolds. The project isstill in progress but I will talk about our recent 
   work of 2-adicdiscussion of Ranicki's theory and one application of this powerful theory to 
   understand Galois actions on smooth complex varieties.

   Title: Hyperbolic translation lengths in (quasi-)median graphs
   
   Abstract: Motivated by the fact that elements of a mapping class group have rational and
   computable translation lengths in the corresponding curve graph, I will explain during 
   the talk how we can show that isometries of quasi-median graphs have rational and computable
   translation lengths in the corresponding crossing graphs. Quasi-median graphs provide a 
   natural generalisation of median graphs, also known as one-skeletons of CAT(0) cube 
   complexes. They appear naturally in the study of graph products of groups. As a concrete 
   application, the theorem applies to right-angled Artin groups and their extension graphs.

        Title:Trivial and non-trivial actions of the Johnson filtration on the homology

        Abstract:Let S=S_{g,1} be a compact, connected, orientable surface of genus g
        with one boundary curve, and let F_n(S) denote the space of ordered 
        configurations of n distinct points in S. The homology groups H_*(F_n(S)) 
        admit a natural action of the mapping class group Mod(S)=pi_0(Diff_+(S,dS)),
        and we are broadly interested in what kind of representations of Mod(S) arise 
        in this way; in particular, how trivial/non-trivial the action of Mod(S) is.
        We consider the Johnson filtration on Mod(S) by subgroups
        J(0)>J(1)>...>J(i)>..., for i>=0. We will compare the following results:
        1) (joint with J.Miller and J.Wilson) J(i) acts trivially on H_*(F_n(S)) for
         i>=n;
        2) (joint with A.Stavrou) If g>=2, J(n-1) acts non-trivially on H_n(F_n(S)).
        3) I will discuss the main ideas of the proofs, and I will conclude with a 
        conjecture.

        Abstract:What is the singular cohomology in algebraic geometry? Classically,
        for smooth varieties X over complex numbers, there are cycle class maps 
        from Chow groups to singular cohomology. For smooth varieties X over real
        numbers, I will construct a real cycle class map from I-cohomology to 
        singular cohomology and show that the real cycle class is compatible with 
        pullbacks, pushforwards, and intersection products. These results are proved 
        in a joint work with J. Hornbostel, M. Wendt, and M. Zibrowius. Together with
        F. Jin, we generalize the real cycle class map construction from smooth
        varieties to singular varieties. I will discuss some applications of the real
        cycle class map.

        Title: Lie groups with a small space of metric structures

        Abstract: In this talk we will consider a family of solvable, non-nilpotent
        Lie groups, including the three-dimensional group SOL. On such a group, any
        pair of left-invariant Riemannian metrics are found to be roughly similar:
        after multiplying one of them by a suitable multiplicative constant, they
        will differ by at most a bounded amount. This allows one to reformulate
        various earlier results about the quasiisometries of these groups in a 
        common framework. I will compare this result with a recent theorem of
        Oregon-Reyes, giving an opposite conclusion when considering non-elementary
        word-hyperbolic groups: the latter are found to have large spaces of metric 
        structures. Joint work with Enrico Le Donne and Xiangdong Xie.

        Title: Martin, Floyd and Bowditch boundaries of relatively hyperbolic groups
        
        Abstract: Consider a transient random walk on a countable group $G$. The 
        Green distance between two points in the group is defined to be minus the
        boundary of the probability that a random path starting at the first point
        ever reaches the second. The Martin compactification of the random walk is 
        a topological space defined to be the horofunction boundary of the Green 
        distance. It is a topological model for the Poisson boundary.
        
       The Martin boundary typically heavily depends on the random walk; it is thus
       exciting when for some large class of random walks, the Martin boundary is 
       equivariantly homeomorphic to some well known geometric boundary of the group.
       Ancona showed in 1988 that this is the case for finitely supported random walks
       on hyperbolic groups: the Martin boundary is identified with the Gromov boundary.
       
       We generalize Ancona's results to relatively hyperbolic groups: the Martin boundary
       equivariantly continuously surjects onto the Gromov boundary of any hyperbolic space
       on which the group acts geometrically finitely (called the Bowditch boundary), and 
       the preimage of any conical limit point is a singleton. When the parabolic subgroups 
       are virtually abelian (e.g. for Kleinian groups) we show that the preimage of a parabolic 
       fixed point is a sphere of appropriate dimension, so the Martin boundary can be identified
       with a Sierpinski carpet. A major technical tool is a generalization of a deviation
       inequality due to Ancona saying the Green distance is nearly additive along word geodesics, 
       which has various other applications, including to comparing harmonic and Patterson-Sullivan 
       measures for negatively curved manifolds and to local limit theorems for random walks.
       
      We do all this using an intermediate construction called the Floyd metric obtaining by 
      suitably rescaling the Cayley graph and considering the associated completion called 
      the Floyd compactification. We show that for any finitely supported random walk on a 
      finitely generated group, the Martin boundary surjects to the Floyd boundary, which 
      in turn by work of Gerasimov covers the Bowditch boundary of relatively hyperbolic 
      groups. This is based on several joint works with subsets of Dussaule, Gerasimov, 
      Potyagailo, and Yang.

       Time: Hyperbolic one-relator groups
       
       Abstract: Since their introduction by Gromov in the 80s, a wealth of tools have been
       developed to study hyperbolic groups. Thus, when studying a class of groups, a 
       characterisation of those that are hyperbolic can be very useful. In this talk we
       will turn to the class of one-relator groups. In previous work, we showed that a 
       one-relator group not containing any Baumslag--Solitar subgroups is hyperbolic, 
       provided it has a Magnus hierarchy in which no one-relator group with a so called 
       `exceptional intersection' appears. I will define one-relator groups with exceptional 
       intersection, discuss the aforementioned result and will then provide a characterisation
       of the hyperbolic one-relator groups with exceptional intersection. Finally, I will then 
       discuss how this characterisation can be used to establish properties for all one-relator
       groups.

       Title: Residually finite quotients via relative cubulation
       
       Abstract: Small cancellation theory is a rich source of cocompactly cubulated 
       groups. The classical C’(1/6) condition has a natural generalization to 
       quotients of free products.  While free products exhibit much more exotic
       behavior than free groups, these quotients act on a Gromov hyperbolic polygonal
       complexes and have been used to solve embedding problems in groups.  When the
       factor groups are assumed to act geometrically on a CAT(0) cube complex, Martin 
       and Steenbock show that such C’(1/6) quotients are again geometrically cubulated. 
       I will describe joint work with Eduard Einstein proving that when the free factors
       are residually finite every C’(1/6) quotient is again residually finite. Our proof
       relies on showing that the quotient groups admit relatively cubulations, a kind of 
       improper action on cube complexes.

       Title: Hyperbolic projections and topological invariance of Morse boundaries
       
       Abstract:When studying hyperbolic spaces, they admit a boundary at infinity that is
       invariant under quasi-isometries. This allows us to associate this boundary as a
       topological invariant to hyperbolic groups. This procedure fails quickly when moving
       to other spaces; already for CAT(0) spaces there are quasi-isometric spaces that have
       non-homeomorphic boundary at infinity. In recent years, several notions of boundaries
       have been introduced to remedy this. One such boundary is the Morse boundary, which,
       for CAT(0) spaces, can be seen as subsets of the visual boundary. However, it turns out 
       that the topology that makes the Morse boundary quasi-isometry-invariant does not coincide 
       with the topology of the visual boundary and the visual topology is not quasi-isometry-invariant
       even when restricted to Morse boundaries.
       In this talk, we will show that nevertheless, the visual topology on Morse boundaries has 
       some decent invariance properties for a large class of examples (most cubulated groups). 
       We will do so by introducing a new method to define a topology on Morse boundaries, show that
       this topology has good invariance properties and that it is a naturally occurring topology 
       for many examples.

       Title: Monodromy of Smooth Quartic Plane Curves
       
       Abstract: We consider the parameter space ${\mathcal U}_d$ of smooth plane curves of degree
       $d$. The universal smooth plane curve of degree $d$ is a fiber bundle 
       $\mathcal{E}_d\to\mathcal{U}_d$ with fiber diffeomorphic to a surface $\Sigma_g$. 
       This bundle gives rise to a monodromy homomorphism $\rho_d:\pi_1(\mathcal{U}_d)\to\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma_g)$, 
       where $\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma_g):=\pi_0(\mathrm{Diff}^+(\Sigma_g))$ is the mapping class group of
       $\Sigma_g$. The main result of this paper is that the kernel of 
       $\rho_4:\pi_1(\mathcal{U}_4)\to\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma_3)$ is isomorphic to 
       $F_\infty\times\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$, where $F_\infty$ is a free group of countably infinite
       rank. In the process of proving this theorem, we show that the complement 
       $\mathcal{T}_g\setminus\mathcal{H}_g$ of the hyperelliptic locus $\mathcal{H}_g$ in 
       Teichm\"uller space $\mathcal{T}_g$ has the homotopy type of an infinite wedge of spheres. 
       As a corollary, we obtain that the moduli space of plane quartic curves is aspherical. 
       The proofs use results from the Weil-Petersson geometry of Teichm\"uller space together 
       with results from algebraic geometry.

      Title: Proper actions of 3-manifold groups on finite product of quasi-trees
    
      Abstract: Let M be a compact, connected, orientable 3-manifold. In this talk,
      I will study when the fundamental group of M acts properly on a finite product 
      of quasi-trees. Our main result is that this is so exactly when M does not 
      contain Sol and Nil geometries. In addition, if there is no $\widetilde{SL(2, \mathbb{R})}$
      geometry either, then the orbital map is a quasi-isometric embedding of $\pi_1(M)$. 
      This is called property (QT) by Bestvina-Bromberg-Fujiwara, who established it for 
      residually finite hyperbolic groups and mapping class groups. The main step of our 
      proof is to show property (QT) for the classes of Croke-Kleiner admissible groups 
      and of  relatively hyperbolic groups under natural assumptions. Accordingly, this 
      yields that graph 3-manifold and mixed 3-manifold groups have property (QT). This 
      represents joint work with N.T. Nguyen and S.Z. Han.

      Title: Mapping class group representations via Heisenberg, Schrödinger and 
      Stone-von Neumann
    
      Abstract: One of the first interesting representations of the braid groups is 
      the Burau representation. It is the first of the family of Lawrence representations, 
      defined topologically by viewing the braid group as the mapping class group of a 
      punctured disc. Famously, the Burau representation is almost never faithful, but 
      the k = 2 Lawrence representation is always faithful: this is a celebrated theorem 
      of Bigelow and Krammer and it implies that braid groups are linear (embed into 
      general linear groups over a field).

      Motivated by this, and by the open question of whether mapping class groups are 
      linear, I will describe recent joint work with Christian Blanchet and Awais Shaukat
      in which we construct analogues of the Lawrence representations for mapping class 
      groups of compact, orientable surfaces. Tools include twisted Borel-Moore homology 
      of configuration spaces, Schrödinger representations of discrete Heisenberg groups 
      and the Stone-von Neumann theorem.

      Title: Distinct distances on hyperbolic surfaces
      
      Abstract:  Erdős (1946) proposed the question of finding the minimal number of 
      distinct distances among any N points in the plane. Guth-Katz (2015) gave almost
      sharp answer for this question using incidence geometry and polynomial 
      partitioning. We consider this problem in hyperbolic surfaces associated with
      cofinite Fuchsian groups, i.e. the volume of the surface is finite. We prove
      a lower bound of the same strength as Guth-Katz. In particular, for any finite
      index subgroup of the modular group, we extract out the dependence of the implied 
      constant on the index.

       Title: An exhaustion of the sphere complex by finite rigid sets
       
       Abstract: A subcomplex X < C of a simplicial complex is rigid if every locally 
       injective, simplicial map X \to C arises as the restriction of an automorphism 
       of $C$.  Curve complexes and other surface complexes have been found to exhibit 
       remarkable rigidity properties. Aramayona and Leininger proved that the curve complex 
       of an orientable surface can be written as an increasing union of finite rigid sets. 
       The sphere complex of a connect sum of $n$ copies of S^1 \times S^2 is an analog 
       the curve complex of a surface used in the study of Out(F_n). In this talk I will
       present joint work with C. Leininger where we prove that there is an exhaustion of 
       the sphere complex by finite rigid sets when n >= 3.

       Title: Fibrations on higher-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds
       
       Abstract: One of the most intriguing aspects in low-dimensional topology is the 
       existence, discovered by Jorgensen in the late 70s, of hyperbolic 3-manifolds that
       fiber over the circle. In this talk we will briefly review some aspects of this 
       beautiful theory, with the notable contributions of Thurston, and more recently 
       of Agol and Wise. 

       Then we will show that this phenomenon is not restricted to dimension 3, by 
       exhibiting some examples in dimension 4 and 5 (in even dimension, some critical 
       points are necessary, and we talk about perfect circle valued Morse functions 
       instead of fibrations). As a consequence, we will deduce that a finite type subgroup
       of a hyperbolic group needs not to be hyperbolic, thus answering a well-known open
       question in geometric group theory (joint works with Battista, Italiano, 
       and Migliorini)

     Title: Complex hyperbolic lattices
       
     Abstract: I will give a survey on recent results about complex hyperbolic lattices. 
     A lattice in a Lie group is a discrete subgroup whose quotient has finite Haar measure.
     In this talk I will concentrate on the Lie group SU(n,1), often restricting to the case 
     where n=2. Elements of this group act as holomorphic isometries of complex hyperbolic 
     space. Roughly speaking, there are four methods of constructing complex hyperbolic 
     lattices. I will discuss how these are related, with particular emphasis on a family 
     of non-arithmetic lattices.

  Title: Large-scale geometry of the saddle connection graph
  
  Abstract: For a translation surface, the associated saddle connection graph has saddle 
  connections as vertices, and edges connecting pairs of non-crossing saddle connections. 
  This can be viewed as an induced subgraph of the arc graph of the surface. In this talk,
  I will discuss both the fine and coarse geometry of the saddle connection graph. We show
  that the isometry type is rigid: any isomorphism between two such graphs is induced by 
  an affine diffeomorphism between the underlying translation surfaces. However, the 
  situation is completely different when one considers the quasi-isometry type: all 
  saddle connection graphs form a single quasi-isometry class. We will also discuss 
  the Gromov boundary in terms of foliations. This is based on joint work with Valentina
  Disarlo, Huiping Pan, and Anja Randecker.

  Title: Choosing points on cubic plane curves 
  
  Abstract: It is a classical topic to study structures of certain special points on
  smooth complex cubic plane curves, for example, the 9 flex points and the 27 sextactic
  points. We consider the following topological question asked by Farb: Is it true 
  that the known algebraic structures give all the possible ways to continuously 
  choose n distinct points on every smooth cubic plane curve, for each given integer
  n? This work is joint with Ishan Banerjee.

       Title: Cohomological properties of Mackey functors for totally disconnected locally compact groups
   
       Abstract: Mackey functors for finite groups are well understood. In the early
       2000s this was extended to infinite discrete groups, and their cohomological 
       finiteness conditions have been expressed in terms of relative cohomology and 
       finiteness conditions of          classifying spaces for proper actions. In 
       this talk I will indicate how one can extend the definition to totally 
       disconnected groups, and will indicate some of the obstacles encountered 
       here. This is ongoing work with Ilaria Castellano and Nadia Mazza.

       Title: Typical behavior of random mapping classes and outer automorphisms
       
       Abstract: Random walks on spaces that manifest hyperbolic properties
       have been studied for decades, as a means to investigate the structure of
       the isometry groups of such spaces. Notable results in this topic include
       descriptions of generic random isometries and limit laws for displacements
       and translation lengths. A recent technique called the pivoting technique
       led to further elaborations in these directions. In this talk, I will describe
       properties of generic random isometries of Teichmuller space or Outer
       space. Namely, generic mapping classes are principal pseudo-Anosovs that
       make displacements with many contracting subsegments. This frequently
       contracting property is shared with generic outer automorphisms, which
       are ageometric fully irreducibles and whose expansion factors differ from
       their inverses'. If time permits, I will explain how this description is related
       to (1) Qing-Rafi's sublinearly Mosre boundaries and (2) limit laws for
       random 3-manifolds.

       Title: Homomorphisms to 3-manifold groups 

       Abstract: Following Sela's theory of limit groups (of free group), we define
       and study limit groups of compact 3-manifold groups. We show that the family 
       of compact 3-manifold groups are equationally noetherian, which answers a 
       question of Agol and Liu.  The main application of our result is to give a 
       positive answer to a question of Reid, Wang and Zhou about epimorphism 
       sequence of closed orientable aspherical 3-manifold groups. This is joint work
       with Daniel Groves and Michael Hull.

      Title: Involution on pseudoisotopy spaces
      
      Abstract: The involution on pseudoisotopy spaces is closely related to the 
      homotopy type of the diffeomorphism group of a smooth compact manifold. In
      this talk, we will introduce some background, a result on computing the 
      involution on pseudoisotopy spaces and its application to space of 
      nonnegatively curved metrics on open manifolds. This is joint work with
      Mauricio Bustamante and Francis Thomas Farrell.

     Title: Generalized wreath products and rigidity of their von Neumann algebras
  
     Abstract: We construct the first positive examples to the Connes’ Rigidity 
     Conjecture, i.e., we construct groups G with Kazhdan’s property (T) such 
     that if H is a group with the same von Neumann algebra as G, then H is isomorphic
     to G. In this talk, I will focus on the group theoretic side of this result
     and talk about how we applied geometric group theory to solve problems from 
     von Neumann algebra.

      Title:  Geometric structure of self covering manifolds
    
      Abstract: A topological space is self-covering if the space is a non-trivial
      cover of itself. I will talk about a joint work with Lizhen Qin and Botong 
      Wang on the geometric structure of self-covering manifolds. For example, 
      we show that in dimension >5, a self-covering manifold with infinite cyclic 
      fundamental group is a fiber bundle over the circle. We also construct examples
      of self-covering manifolds which are not fiber bundle over the circle, where 
      the fundamental group contains torsion.
