  Title: Quasi-isometric rigidity for a product of lattices
  
  Abstract: Quasi-isometric rigidity theorems contribute to Gromov's program of classifying 
  finitely generated groups up to quasi-isometry. In this talk we discuss the quasi-isometric
  rigidity for the class of groups N x L, where N is a lattice in a simply connected nilpotent
  Lie group and L is a non-uniform lattice in a rank one semisimple Lie group. Such a group is,
  up to finite noise, an extension by a nilpotent lattice of a non-uniform lattice commensurable
  to L. This is the first step towards proving quasi-isometric rigidity for a class of spaces 
  generalizing high-dimensional graph manifolds, as defined by Frigerio-Lafont-Sisto.

  Title: Torsion in 1-cusped Picard modular groups
  
  Abstract: We discuss a systematic effective method to construct coarse fundamental domains
  for the action of the Picard modular groups PU(2,1,O_d). We demand that the ring O_d of
  algebraic integers in Q(i√d) has class number one, i.e. d=1,2,3,7,11,19,43,67,163. The 
  computations can be performed quickly up to the value d=19. As an application of this 
  method, we classify conjugacy classes of torsion elements, deduce short presentations 
  for the groups, and construct neat subgroups of small index. This is joint work with
  M. Deraux.

  Title: Computing high-dimensional group cohomology via duality
  
  Abstract: In recent years, duality approaches have yielded new results about the 
  high-dimensional cohomology of several groups and moduli spaces, such as SL<sub>n</sub>(<b>Z</b>) 
  and M<sub>g</sub>. I will explain the general strategy of these approaches and survey 
  results that have been obtained so far.

  To give an example, I will first explain how Borel-Serre duality can be used to show that
  the rational cohomology of SL<sub>n</sub>(<b>Z</b>) vanishes near its virtual cohomological
  dimension. This is based on joint work with Miller-Patzt-Sroka-Wilson and builds on results
  by Church-Farb-Putman.
  
  I will then put this into a more general context by giving an overview of analogous results
  for mapping class groups of surfaces, automorphism groups of free groups and further 
  arithmetic groups such as SL<sub>n</sub>(O<sub>K</sub>) and Sp<sub>2n</sub>(<b>Z</b>).

  Title: The earthquake metric
  
  Abstract: Earthquakes are natural generalisations of Fenchel-Nielsen twists deformations
  on Teichmueller space, and Thurston’s remarkable earthquake theorem asserts that any 
  hyperbolic metric on a given closed surface can be deformed to any other by a unique 
  (left) earthquake. This was famously employed by Kerckhoff in his proof of the Nielsen
  realisation problem, which quickly cemented their importance in Teichmüller theory. 
  Geometrically speaking, however, (long) Earthquake paths are far from being “twist 
  efficient” - indeed, Mirzakhani shows that earthquake flows on Teichmüller space are
  measure conjugate to the horocyclic flow. Motivated by wishing to understand how one
  might efficiently “earthquake” between hyperbolic structures, we initiate the first 
  systematic study of the earthquake metric—a Finsler metric first introduced in 
  Thurston’s “Minimal stretch maps between hyperbolic surfaces” preprint, and discover
  surprising connections to both the Thurston metric and the Weil-Petersson metric. 
  This is work in collaboration with K. Ohshika, H. Pan and A. Papadopoulos.

   Title: The existence of arbitrary large number of non R-covered Anosov flows on hyperbolic 3-manifolds
   
   Abstract: We will talk about a result about Anosov flows on hyperbolic three manifolds, 
   which says that for every positive integer n, there exists a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold
   M that carries at least n pairwise different (i.e., not orbitally equivalent) non R-covered
   Anosov flows. This is a joint work with Francois Beguin.

  Title: From telescopes to frames and simple groups
  
  Abstract: I will introduce the notion of a telescope of groups. Very roughly a telescope
  is a directed system of groups that contains various commuting images of some fixed group B.
  Imitating known constructions of groups acting on rooted trees, we obtain a number of 
  examples of B-telescopes and discuss several applications.
 
  We give examples of  2-generated  infinite amenable simple groups. We show that every 
  finitely generated residually finite (amenable) group embeds into a finitely generated 
  (amenable) simple LEF-group. We construct 2-generated frames in products of finite simple 
  groups and show that there are Grothendieck pairs consisting of amenable groups and groups 
  with property (tau). This talk is based on a joint work with Steffen Kionke.

   interesting observation about one-relator groups with torsion.

   Title: Computing Scale in Neretin's group
   
   Abstract: For an automorphism of a totally disconnected, locally compact group, Willis introduced 
   the notion of scale which provides information on its behavior. In this talk, we will discuss 
   the setting where the tdlc group is Neretin's group and where the automorphism comes from conjugation
   in the group. This is an ongoing joint work with Michal Ferov and George Willis at the University of Newcastle.

   Title: Arithmetic approximate lattices and their finiteness properties
   
   Abstract: Approximate groups were identified as a natural framework for
   geometric group theory by Björklund and Hartnick and further developed
   by Cordes, Hartnick and Tonić, unifying previous research on apparently
   disparate areas such as finite approximate groups (Breuillard, Green,
   Tao) and quasi-crystals (Meyer and others).

   Approximate groups arise naturally via a cut-and-project procedure from
   lattices in locally compact groups. A central point I want to make is
   that S-arithmetic groups are, by their standard definition, the result
   of cut-and-project procedure. They happen to be groups as long as S
   contains all infinite places, an assumption usually imposed.

   In the context of approximate groups, that assumption can be lifted and
   gives rise to S-arithmetic approximate groups in characteristic 0 that
   are not groups but resemble S-arithmetic groups in positive
   characteristic. The finiteness properties of S-arithmetic subgroups of
   reductive groups in positive characteristic are determined by the Rank
   Theorem (joint with Bux and Köhl). I will present joint work with Tobias
   Hartnick proving a Rank Theorem for S-arithmetic approximate groups in
   characteristic 0.

    Title: Intersection of parabolic subgroups in Artin groups
    
    Abstract: Artin groups are a natural generalisation of braid groups from an 
    algebraic point of view: in the same way that braids are obtained from the
    presentation of the symmetric group, other Coxeter groups give rise to more 
    general Artin groups. There are very few results proven for every Artin group. 
    To study them, specialists have focused on some special kind of subgroup, called
    "parabolic subgroups".  These groups are used to build important simplicial complexes,
    as the Deligne complex or the recent complex of irreducible parabolic subgroups. The 
    question "Is the intersection of parabolic subgroups a parabolic subgroup?" is a very
    basic question whose answer was only known for RAAGs until 2018. In this talk, we will
    speak about the progress on that matter since then, starting with the breakthrough of 
    the positive answer for spherical-type Artin groups and we will see how we can answer 
    this question in Artin groups of large type, by using the geometric realisation of the
    poset of parabolic subgroups, that we have named "Artin complex". In particular, we 
    will show that this complex in the large case has a property called sistolicity (a 
    sort of weak CAT(0) property) that allows us to apply techniques from geometric group
    theory. These are a joint works with Volker Gebhardt, Juan González-Meneses, Bert 
    Wiest, Alexandre Martin and Nicolas Vaskou.

  Title: Noncommutative Gröbner basis and Ext groups

  Abstract: The Gröbner basis is a powerful tool in commutative algebra. We can use it to do many 
  calculations such as computing the presentations of the kernel and cokernel of a map between 
  finitely presented modules over a commutative algebra. However, many important algebras including 
  the Steenrod algebra in algebraic topology are not commutative. We make a noncommutative generalization 
  of the Gröbner basis which can be applied to the Steenrod algebra A. This leads to highly efficient
  calculations in the category of A-modules including the computation of E2 pages of Adams spectral
  sequences.

   Abstract: A theorem of Furstenberg from 1967 states that if Gamma is a lattice in a semisimple Lie group 
   G, then there exists a measure on Gamma with finite first moment such that the corresponding harmonic 
   measure on the Furstenberg boundary is absolutely continuous. We will discuss generalizations of this 
   theorem in the setting of the Mapping class group and Gromov hyperbolic groups

   Title: Algebraic Model of Manifolds
   
   Abstract: The surgery theory of dimension at least 5 stayedinthecentral position of classification of
   manifolds in the last century. In1970s, Ranicki invented the cosheaf theory of derived quadraticforms 
   to give an algebraic discription of the existence of highdimensional manifolds over a fixed homotopy
   type andthehomotopy manifold classifications. On the other hand, we couldunderstand a homotopy type
   by passage to rational andp-adicinformation. Quillen and Sullivan individually developedtherational
   homotopy theories. Sullivan sketched the approachtoalgebraize simply connected rational manifolds,
   i.e., a free dgaoverQ together with a Poincare duality and several rational Pontryaginclasses, and 
   Zhixu Su completed the proof in her thesis. About twodecades ago, Mandell proved that E-inifinity 
   algebras over Fp-barcanb be the algebraic models of p-adic nilpotent homotopytypes. Five years ago, 
   Rivera and Zeinalian showed that the cobarconstruction of coalgebras could give algebraic models of
   integral homotopy types. We want to generalize Sullivan's rational discussionof manifolds to give 
   algebraic models of manifolds. The project isstill in progress but I will talk about our recent 
   work of 2-adicdiscussion of Ranicki's theory and one application of this powerful theory to 
   understand Galois actions on smooth complex varieties.

   Title: Hyperbolic translation lengths in (quasi-)median graphs
   
   Abstract: Motivated by the fact that elements of a mapping class group have rational and
   computable translation lengths in the corresponding curve graph, I will explain during 
   the talk how we can show that isometries of quasi-median graphs have rational and computable
   translation lengths in the corresponding crossing graphs. Quasi-median graphs provide a 
   natural generalisation of median graphs, also known as one-skeletons of CAT(0) cube 
   complexes. They appear naturally in the study of graph products of groups. As a concrete 
   application, the theorem applies to right-angled Artin groups and their extension graphs.

        Title:Trivial and non-trivial actions of the Johnson filtration on the homology
        of configuration spaces
        
        Abstract:Let S=S_{g,1} be a compact, connected, orientable surface of genus g
        with one boundary curve, and let F_n(S) denote the space of ordered 
        configurations of n distinct points in S. The homology groups H_*(F_n(S)) 
        admit a natural action of the mapping class group Mod(S)=pi_0(Diff_+(S,dS)),
        and we are broadly interested in what kind of representations of Mod(S) arise 
        in this way; in particular, how trivial/non-trivial the action of Mod(S) is.
        We consider the Johnson filtration on Mod(S) by subgroups
        J(0)>J(1)>...>J(i)>..., for i>=0. We will compare the following results:
        1) (joint with J.Miller and J.Wilson) J(i) acts trivially on H_*(F_n(S)) for
         i>=n;
        2) (joint with A.Stavrou) If g>=2, J(n-1) acts non-trivially on H_n(F_n(S)).
        3) I will discuss the main ideas of the proofs, and I will conclude with a 
        conjecture.

        Title: The real cycle class map and its applications
        
        Abstract:What is the singular cohomology in algebraic geometry? Classically,
        for smooth varieties X over complex numbers, there are cycle class maps 
        from Chow groups to singular cohomology. For smooth varieties X over real
        numbers, I will construct a real cycle class map from I-cohomology to 
        singular cohomology and show that the real cycle class is compatible with 
        pullbacks, pushforwards, and intersection products. These results are proved 
        in a joint work with J. Hornbostel, M. Wendt, and M. Zibrowius. Together with
        F. Jin, we generalize the real cycle class map construction from smooth
        varieties to singular varieties. I will discuss some applications of the real
        cycle class map.

        Title: Lie groups with a small space of metric structures

        Abstract: In this talk we will consider a family of solvable, non-nilpotent
        Lie groups, including the three-dimensional group SOL. On such a group, any
        pair of left-invariant Riemannian metrics are found to be roughly similar:
        after multiplying one of them by a suitable multiplicative constant, they
        will differ by at most a bounded amount. This allows one to reformulate
        various earlier results about the quasiisometries of these groups in a 
        common framework. I will compare this result with a recent theorem of
        Oregon-Reyes, giving an opposite conclusion when considering non-elementary
        word-hyperbolic groups: the latter are found to have large spaces of metric 
        structures. Joint work with Enrico Le Donne and Xiangdong Xie.

        Title: Martin, Floyd and Bowditch boundaries of relatively hyperbolic groups
        
        Abstract: Consider a transient random walk on a countable group $G$. The 
        Green distance between two points in the group is defined to be minus the
        boundary of the probability that a random path starting at the first point
        ever reaches the second. The Martin compactification of the random walk is 
        a topological space defined to be the horofunction boundary of the Green 
        distance. It is a topological model for the Poisson boundary.
        
       The Martin boundary typically heavily depends on the random walk; it is thus
       exciting when for some large class of random walks, the Martin boundary is 
       equivariantly homeomorphic to some well known geometric boundary of the group.
       Ancona showed in 1988 that this is the case for finitely supported random walks
       on hyperbolic groups: the Martin boundary is identified with the Gromov boundary.
       
       We generalize Ancona's results to relatively hyperbolic groups: the Martin boundary
       equivariantly continuously surjects onto the Gromov boundary of any hyperbolic space
       on which the group acts geometrically finitely (called the Bowditch boundary), and 
       the preimage of any conical limit point is a singleton. When the parabolic subgroups 
       are virtually abelian (e.g. for Kleinian groups) we show that the preimage of a parabolic 
       fixed point is a sphere of appropriate dimension, so the Martin boundary can be identified
       with a Sierpinski carpet. A major technical tool is a generalization of a deviation
       inequality due to Ancona saying the Green distance is nearly additive along word geodesics, 
       which has various other applications, including to comparing harmonic and Patterson-Sullivan 
       measures for negatively curved manifolds and to local limit theorems for random walks.
       
      We do all this using an intermediate construction called the Floyd metric obtaining by 
      suitably rescaling the Cayley graph and considering the associated completion called 
      the Floyd compactification. We show that for any finitely supported random walk on a 
      finitely generated group, the Martin boundary surjects to the Floyd boundary, which 
      in turn by work of Gerasimov covers the Bowditch boundary of relatively hyperbolic 
      groups. This is based on several joint works with subsets of Dussaule, Gerasimov, 
      Potyagailo, and Yang.

       Time: Hyperbolic one-relator groups
       
       Abstract: Since their introduction by Gromov in the 80s, a wealth of tools have been
       developed to study hyperbolic groups. Thus, when studying a class of groups, a 
       characterisation of those that are hyperbolic can be very useful. In this talk we
       will turn to the class of one-relator groups. In previous work, we showed that a 
       one-relator group not containing any Baumslag--Solitar subgroups is hyperbolic, 
       provided it has a Magnus hierarchy in which no one-relator group with a so called 
       `exceptional intersection' appears. I will define one-relator groups with exceptional 
       intersection, discuss the aforementioned result and will then provide a characterisation
       of the hyperbolic one-relator groups with exceptional intersection. Finally, I will then 
       discuss how this characterisation can be used to establish properties for all one-relator
       groups.

       Title: Residually finite quotients via relative cubulation
       
       Abstract: Small cancellation theory is a rich source of cocompactly cubulated 
       groups. The classical C’(1/6) condition has a natural generalization to 
       quotients of free products.  While free products exhibit much more exotic
       behavior than free groups, these quotients act on a Gromov hyperbolic polygonal
       complexes and have been used to solve embedding problems in groups.  When the
       factor groups are assumed to act geometrically on a CAT(0) cube complex, Martin 
       and Steenbock show that such C’(1/6) quotients are again geometrically cubulated. 
       I will describe joint work with Eduard Einstein proving that when the free factors
       are residually finite every C’(1/6) quotient is again residually finite. Our proof
       relies on showing that the quotient groups admit relatively cubulations, a kind of 
       improper action on cube complexes.

       Title: Hyperbolic projections and topological invariance of Morse boundaries
       
       Abstract:When studying hyperbolic spaces, they admit a boundary at infinity that is
       invariant under quasi-isometries. This allows us to associate this boundary as a
       topological invariant to hyperbolic groups. This procedure fails quickly when moving
       to other spaces; already for CAT(0) spaces there are quasi-isometric spaces that have
       non-homeomorphic boundary at infinity. In recent years, several notions of boundaries
       have been introduced to remedy this. One such boundary is the Morse boundary, which,
       for CAT(0) spaces, can be seen as subsets of the visual boundary. However, it turns out 
       that the topology that makes the Morse boundary quasi-isometry-invariant does not coincide 
       with the topology of the visual boundary and the visual topology is not quasi-isometry-invariant
       even when restricted to Morse boundaries.
       In this talk, we will show that nevertheless, the visual topology on Morse boundaries has 
       some decent invariance properties for a large class of examples (most cubulated groups). 
       We will do so by introducing a new method to define a topology on Morse boundaries, show that
       this topology has good invariance properties and that it is a naturally occurring topology 
       for many examples.

       Title: Monodromy of Smooth Quartic Plane Curves
       
       Abstract: We consider the parameter space ${\mathcal U}_d$ of smooth plane curves of degree
       $d$. The universal smooth plane curve of degree $d$ is a fiber bundle 
       $\mathcal{E}_d\to\mathcal{U}_d$ with fiber diffeomorphic to a surface $\Sigma_g$. 
       This bundle gives rise to a monodromy homomorphism $\rho_d:\pi_1(\mathcal{U}_d)\to\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma_g)$, 
       where $\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma_g):=\pi_0(\mathrm{Diff}^+(\Sigma_g))$ is the mapping class group of
       $\Sigma_g$. The main result of this paper is that the kernel of 
       $\rho_4:\pi_1(\mathcal{U}_4)\to\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma_3)$ is isomorphic to 
       $F_\infty\times\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$, where $F_\infty$ is a free group of countably infinite
       rank. In the process of proving this theorem, we show that the complement 
       $\mathcal{T}_g\setminus\mathcal{H}_g$ of the hyperelliptic locus $\mathcal{H}_g$ in 
       Teichm\"uller space $\mathcal{T}_g$ has the homotopy type of an infinite wedge of spheres. 
       As a corollary, we obtain that the moduli space of plane quartic curves is aspherical. 
       The proofs use results from the Weil-Petersson geometry of Teichm\"uller space together 
       with results from algebraic geometry.

       Title: Presentations for cusped arithmetic hyperbolic lattices
       
       Abstract: We present a general method to compute a presentation for any cusped hyperbolic
       lattice $\Gamma$, applying a classical result of Macbeath to a suitable $\Gamma$-invariant 
       horoball cover of the corresponding symmetric space.  As applications we compute presentations
       for the Picard modular groups ${\rm PU}(2,1,\mathcal{O}_d)$ for $d=1,3,7$ and the quaternionic 
       lattice ${\rm PU}(2,1,\mathcal{H})$ with entries in the Hurwitz integer ring $\mathcal{H}$. 
       This is joint work with Alice Mark.

        Title: The Kaplansky conjectures
        
        Abstract: There is a series of four fundamental and long-standing conjectures on group rings 
        attributed to Kaplansky. For example, the zero divisor conjecture states that the group ring
        of a torsion-free group with field coefficients has no zero divisors. I will discuss these conjectures,
        their connections to other open questions in various areas of mathematics, and my recent disproof of the
        unit conjecture.

      Abstract: A manifolds M is called string manifold i its free loop space LM is spin.
      There are many studies on the string geometry. Dimension 24 is in particular
      interesting for string geometry. In the talk, I will report our work on the study
      of characteristic numbers and index theoretic invariants for 24 dimensional
      string manifolds and string cobordism following Mahowald-Hopkins. This represents

      Title: Proper actions of 3-manifold groups on finite product of quasi-trees
    
      Abstract: Let M be a compact, connected, orientable 3-manifold. In this talk,
      I will study when the fundamental group of M acts properly on a finite product 
      of quasi-trees. Our main result is that this is so exactly when M does not 
      contain Sol and Nil geometries. In addition, if there is no $\widetilde{SL(2, \mathbb{R})}$
      geometry either, then the orbital map is a quasi-isometric embedding of $\pi_1(M)$. 
      This is called property (QT) by Bestvina-Bromberg-Fujiwara, who established it for 
      residually finite hyperbolic groups and mapping class groups. The main step of our 
      proof is to show property (QT) for the classes of Croke-Kleiner admissible groups 
      and of  relatively hyperbolic groups under natural assumptions. Accordingly, this 
      yields that graph 3-manifold and mixed 3-manifold groups have property (QT). This 
      represents joint work with N.T. Nguyen and S.Z. Han.

      Title: Mapping class group representations via Heisenberg, Schrödinger and 
      Stone-von Neumann
    
      Abstract: One of the first interesting representations of the braid groups is 
      the Burau representation. It is the first of the family of Lawrence representations, 
      defined topologically by viewing the braid group as the mapping class group of a 
      punctured disc. Famously, the Burau representation is almost never faithful, but 
      the k = 2 Lawrence representation is always faithful: this is a celebrated theorem 
      of Bigelow and Krammer and it implies that braid groups are linear (embed into 
      general linear groups over a field).

      Motivated by this, and by the open question of whether mapping class groups are 
      linear, I will describe recent joint work with Christian Blanchet and Awais Shaukat
      in which we construct analogues of the Lawrence representations for mapping class 
      groups of compact, orientable surfaces. Tools include twisted Borel-Moore homology 
      of configuration spaces, Schrödinger representations of discrete Heisenberg groups 
      and the Stone-von Neumann theorem.

      Title: Distinct distances on hyperbolic surfaces
      
      Abstract:  Erdős (1946) proposed the question of finding the minimal number of 
      distinct distances among any N points in the plane. Guth-Katz (2015) gave almost
      sharp answer for this question using incidence geometry and polynomial 
      partitioning. We consider this problem in hyperbolic surfaces associated with
      cofinite Fuchsian groups, i.e. the volume of the surface is finite. We prove
      a lower bound of the same strength as Guth-Katz. In particular, for any finite
      index subgroup of the modular group, we extract out the dependence of the implied 
      constant on the index.

       Title: An exhaustion of the sphere complex by finite rigid sets
       
       Abstract: A subcomplex X < C of a simplicial complex is rigid if every locally 
       injective, simplicial map X \to C arises as the restriction of an automorphism 
       of $C$.  Curve complexes and other surface complexes have been found to exhibit 
       remarkable rigidity properties. Aramayona and Leininger proved that the curve complex 
       of an orientable surface can be written as an increasing union of finite rigid sets. 
       The sphere complex of a connect sum of $n$ copies of S^1 \times S^2 is an analog 
       the curve complex of a surface used in the study of Out(F_n). In this talk I will
       present joint work with C. Leininger where we prove that there is an exhaustion of 
       the sphere complex by finite rigid sets when n >= 3.

       Title: Fibrations on higher-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds
       
       Abstract: One of the most intriguing aspects in low-dimensional topology is the 
       existence, discovered by Jorgensen in the late 70s, of hyperbolic 3-manifolds that
       fiber over the circle. In this talk we will briefly review some aspects of this 
       beautiful theory, with the notable contributions of Thurston, and more recently 
       of Agol and Wise. 

       Then we will show that this phenomenon is not restricted to dimension 3, by 
       exhibiting some examples in dimension 4 and 5 (in even dimension, some critical 
       points are necessary, and we talk about perfect circle valued Morse functions 
       instead of fibrations). As a consequence, we will deduce that a finite type subgroup
       of a hyperbolic group needs not to be hyperbolic, thus answering a well-known open
       question in geometric group theory (joint works with Battista, Italiano, 
       and Migliorini)

     Title: Complex hyperbolic lattices
       
     Abstract: I will give a survey on recent results about complex hyperbolic lattices. 
     A lattice in a Lie group is a discrete subgroup whose quotient has finite Haar measure.
     In this talk I will concentrate on the Lie group SU(n,1), often restricting to the case 
     where n=2. Elements of this group act as holomorphic isometries of complex hyperbolic 
     space. Roughly speaking, there are four methods of constructing complex hyperbolic 
     lattices. I will discuss how these are related, with particular emphasis on a family 
     of non-arithmetic lattices.

  Title: Large-scale geometry of the saddle connection graph
  
  Abstract: For a translation surface, the associated saddle connection graph has saddle 
  connections as vertices, and edges connecting pairs of non-crossing saddle connections. 
  This can be viewed as an induced subgraph of the arc graph of the surface. In this talk,
  I will discuss both the fine and coarse geometry of the saddle connection graph. We show
  that the isometry type is rigid: any isomorphism between two such graphs is induced by 
  an affine diffeomorphism between the underlying translation surfaces. However, the 
  situation is completely different when one considers the quasi-isometry type: all 
  saddle connection graphs form a single quasi-isometry class. We will also discuss 
  the Gromov boundary in terms of foliations. This is based on joint work with Valentina
  Disarlo, Huiping Pan, and Anja Randecker.

  Title: Choosing points on cubic plane curves 
  
  Abstract: It is a classical topic to study structures of certain special points on
  smooth complex cubic plane curves, for example, the 9 flex points and the 27 sextactic
  points. We consider the following topological question asked by Farb: Is it true 
  that the known algebraic structures give all the possible ways to continuously 
  choose n distinct points on every smooth cubic plane curve, for each given integer
  n? This work is joint with Ishan Banerjee.

       Title: Cohomological properties of Mackey functors for totally disconnected locally compact groups
   
       Abstract: Mackey functors for finite groups are well understood. In the early
       2000s this was extended to infinite discrete groups, and their cohomological 
       finiteness conditions have been expressed in terms of relative cohomology and 
       finiteness conditions of          classifying spaces for proper actions. In 
       this talk I will indicate how one can extend the definition to totally 
       disconnected groups, and will indicate some of the obstacles encountered 
       here. This is ongoing work with Ilaria Castellano and Nadia Mazza.

       Title: Typical behavior of random mapping classes and outer automorphisms
       
       Abstract: Random walks on spaces that manifest hyperbolic properties
       have been studied for decades, as a means to investigate the structure of
       the isometry groups of such spaces. Notable results in this topic include
       descriptions of generic random isometries and limit laws for displacements
       and translation lengths. A recent technique called the pivoting technique
       led to further elaborations in these directions. In this talk, I will describe
       properties of generic random isometries of Teichmuller space or Outer
       space. Namely, generic mapping classes are principal pseudo-Anosovs that
       make displacements with many contracting subsegments. This frequently
       contracting property is shared with generic outer automorphisms, which
       are ageometric fully irreducibles and whose expansion factors differ from
       their inverses'. If time permits, I will explain how this description is related
       to (1) Qing-Rafi's sublinearly Mosre boundaries and (2) limit laws for
       random 3-manifolds.

      of self-covering manifolds which are not fiber bundle over the circle, where
