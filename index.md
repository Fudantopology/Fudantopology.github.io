      Title:  Geometric structure of self covering manifolds
    
      Abstract: A topological space is self-covering if the spaceisanon-trivial
      cover of itself. I will talk about a joint work withLizhen Qin and Botong 
      Wang on the geometric structure of self-coveringmanifolds. For example, 
      we show that in dimension >5, aself-covering manifold with infinite cyclic 
      fundamental groupisafiber bundle over the circle. We also construct examples
      ofself-covering manifolds which are not fiber bundle over the circle, where 
      the fundamental group contains torsion.

      Title: The group of quasi-isometries of the line cannot act effectively on the line
    
      Abstract: Let G be the group of orientation-preservingquasi-isometries of the 
      real line. We show that Gis left-orderable, but not simple. Moreover, the group G 
      cannot act effectivelyonthereal line R.
